# Advent of Code 2023 in Elm

It's first time to use Elm, so code may not be perfect.

## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm install  # Install `elm` and `elm-go`
pnpm dev      # Run `dev` script
```

Or, if you have `elm` and `elm-go` in global and are in Linux environment, then:

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
